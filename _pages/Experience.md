Experience
======
* Graduate Research Assistant, Microgrid Laboratory, SDSU, USA (Aug. 2021 - Current)
  * Carried out a comparative analysis of state and parameter estimation techniques  for power system frequency dynamics
  * Evaluated computation time requirement of estimation filter {Kalman filter, extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman filter and moving horizon estimation} for          power system frequency dynamics using Opal-RT real-time simulator
  * Formulated a system identification algorithm using the least square method in MATLAB to model the dynamics of a power electronic converter with advanced grid support     functionality
  * Created a data-driven model of a grid-connected SMA inverter using a Puissance Plus power amplifier unit and Opal-RT real-time simulator system for multiple input       single output (MISO) scenarios
  * Designed probing signal and evaluated grid support functions in Fronious Symo (3-phase) and SMA (2-phase) inverters using a power-hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) testbed
  * Analyzed effect of varying irradiance in data-driven modeling of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) inverter dynamics
  * Automated data-driven model extraction and validation of inverter dynamics with grid support functions 
* Electrical Engineer, Prism International Engineering Nepal Private Limited, Kathmandu, Nepal (Dec. 2020 - Jun. 2021)
  * Calculated technical loss of the existing Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA's) distribution system and recommended distribution loss reduction master plan
  * Coordinated with different distribution centres (DCs) of Bagmati Province for the preparation of technical data as per the requirement of project
* Intern, Codniv Innovations Private Limited, Kathmandu, Nepal (Jan. 2020 - March. 2020)
  * Developed modular program for integration of GIS file required for electrical analysis
  * Analyzed data with the available electrical data of electrical system obtained from client
